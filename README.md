Grappling Tracker is a web-based application tailored for grappling enthusiasts to track and analyze their training sessions, techniques, and progress over time. It provides a user-friendly dashboard for logging training details, viewing statistics, and managing one's martial arts journey effectively. It's a long-time project for myself that emerged from my own need of keeping track of my training.
